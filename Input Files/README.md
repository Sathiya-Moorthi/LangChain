# 📥 Input Files

Sample input files used by the LangChain learning scripts for data ingestion and processing demonstrations.

## 📁 Contents

| File | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `UU_EktaVats_AI_Physics.pdf` | PDF | Sample PDF document for document loading tutorials |
| `notes.txt` | Text | Simple text file for basic text processing examples |

## 🎯 Purpose

These files are used in the `/Script/` notebooks to demonstrate:

- **Document Loaders**: Loading PDFs and text files with LangChain
- **Text Splitting**: Chunking documents for processing
- **Data Ingestion**: End-to-end document processing pipelines

## ⚠️ Notes

- Large files like PDFs may be excluded from version control
- You can add your own files here for testing
- Ensure file paths in notebooks match your local structure
